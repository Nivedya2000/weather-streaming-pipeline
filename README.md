# üå¶Ô∏è Real-Time Weather Data Pipeline

This project is an **end-to-end streaming pipeline** that fetches
weather forecast data from the **OpenWeather API**, streams it through
**Apache Kafka**, processes it with **Apache Spark Structured
Streaming**, and stores it into **AWS S3** and **Snowflake** for
analytics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìÇ Project Structure

-   **producer.py** ‚Üí Fetches weather data from OpenWeather API and
    pushes it into Kafka (`topic2`).
-   **kafka_spark_test.py** ‚Üí Spark consumer to test and validate
    incoming Kafka messages.
-   **weather.py** ‚Üí Standalone script to fetch and display weather
    forecast (without Kafka).
-   **aws_s3.py** ‚Üí Spark streaming consumer that writes weather data
    into **AWS S3 (CSV format)**.
-   **snowflake.py** ‚Üí Spark streaming consumer that writes weather data
    into **Snowflake tables**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

-   **Apache Kafka** ‚Üí Message broker for streaming weather data.
-   **Apache Spark (Structured Streaming)** ‚Üí Stream processing engine.
-   **AWS S3** ‚Üí Data lake storage (CSV).
-   **Snowflake** ‚Üí Cloud data warehouse for analytics.
-   **OpenWeather API** ‚Üí Weather forecast provider.
-   **Python (3.8+)** ‚Üí Programming language for producer and consumers.
-   **python-dotenv** ‚Üí For managing credentials securely.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üîê Configuration

### `.env` file

Create a `.env` file in your project root (not committed to GitHub):

    # OpenWeather API
    OPENWEATHER_API_KEY=your_openweather_api_key

    # AWS Config
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
    S3_BUCKET_NAME=weatherapi-nivedya

    # Snowflake Config
    SNOWFLAKE_URL=https://your_account.snowflakecomputing.com
    SNOWFLAKE_USER=your_username
    SNOWFLAKE_PASSWORD=your_password
    SNOWFLAKE_DATABASE=my_database
    SNOWFLAKE_SCHEMA=my_schema
    SNOWFLAKE_WAREHOUSE=my_warehouse

    # Kafka Config
    KAFKA_BROKER=localhost:9092
    KAFKA_TOPIC=topic2

### `.gitignore`

    .env
    __pycache__/
    *.log
    *.csv

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Pipeline

### Step 1: Start Kafka & Zookeeper

``` bash
zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties
```

Create the topic:

``` bash
kafka-topics.sh --create --topic topic2 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
```

### Step 2: Run the Producer

``` bash
python producer.py
```

This fetches weather data for **Kochi, Bangalore, and Mumbai** and
publishes to Kafka.

### Step 3: Test Consumer (Optional)

``` bash
python kafka_spark_test.py
```

This verifies data ingestion and schema parsing.

### Step 4: Stream to AWS S3

``` bash
python aws_s3.py
```

Stores Kafka data batches as CSV in your **S3 bucket**.

### Step 5: Stream to Snowflake

``` bash
python snowflake.py
```

Writes Kafka data into **Snowflake tables**.

It looks like you've shared a screenshot of a terminal session where you're setting up a Git repository for a project called "weather-streaming-pipeline" on GitHub. Here's a summary of the steps you've taken:

    Initialized a Git repository (git init).
    Created and added a README.md file.
    Staged the README.md file and a .gitignore file (git add README.md .gitignore).
    Committed the changes with the message "first commit" (git commit -m "first commit").
    Created a main branch (git branch -M main).
    Added a remote repository on GitHub (git remote add origin <URL>).
    Pushed the main branch to the remote repository (git push -u origin main).

The process seems to be on track for setting up your project on GitHub. If you encounter any issues or need further assistance, feel free to ask!
yes its failed so may times

It sounds frustrating that the process has failed multiple times. Based on the screenshot, it looks like the git push -u origin main command might not have completed successfully. This could be due to authentication issues, an incorrect remote URL, or network problems. Double-check the remote URL with git remote -v and ensure you're logged into GitHub with the correct credentials. If the issue persists, try git push origin main again or troubleshoot with git status to see the current state of your repository. Let me know what error messages you get, and I can help further!
Refer to the following content:

The error in the screenshot indicates a "fatal: Authentication failed" issue when trying to push to the remote repository at https://github.com/Nivedya2000/weather-streaming-pipeline.git. This is likely because GitHub no longer supports username/password authentication for Git operations. Instead, you need to use a personal access token (PAT). Here's what you can do:

    Generate a PAT on GitHub:
        Go to GitHub > Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens > Generate new token.
        Give it appropriate permissions (e.g., repo scope) and copy the token.
    Update your remote URL to use the token:
        Run: git remote set-url origin https://<your-username>:<your-token>@github.com/Nivedya2000/weather-streaming-pipeline.git
        Replace <your-username> with your GitHub username and <your-token> with the PAT you generated.
    Try pushing again:
        Run: git push origin main

Double-check the remote URL with git remote -v to ensure it‚Äôs correct. If the issue persists, let me know the new error message, and I can assist further!
suggest another way

Another way to resolve the authentication issue is to use SSH instead of HTTPS. Here's how you can set it up:

    Check for SSH Keys:
        Run ls -al ~/.ssh to see if you already have an SSH key pair (e.g., id_rsa and id_rsa.pub). If not, generate one with ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com".
    Add SSH Key to SSH Agent:
        Start the SSH agent: eval "$(ssh-agent -s)".
        Add your private key: ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa.
    Add Public Key to GitHub:
        Copy your public key: cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
        Go to GitHub > Settings > SSH and GPG keys > New SSH key, and paste the key.
    Update Remote URL to SSH:
        Change the remote URL to use SSH: git remote set-url origin git@github.com:Nivedya2000/weather-streaming-pipeline.git.
    Test and Push:
        Test the connection: ssh -T git@github.com.
        Push your changes: git push origin main.

This method avoids using a personal access token and relies on SSH keys. Let me know if you run into any issues!
Refer to the following content:

The error indicates that your push was blocked due to the presence of sensitive information (an Amazon AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key) in your repository. GitHub's secret scanning detected these secrets, and push protection has prevented the push to protect your security. Here's how to resolve this:

    Remove the Secrets from Your Repository:
        Open the files listed (e.g., aws_s3.py at lines 16 and 17) and remove the AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key.
        Use environment variables or a secure configuration management tool (like AWS Secrets Manager) to store these credentials instead.
    Amend the Commit:
        Run git reset --soft HEAD^ to undo the last commit.
        Edit the files to remove the secrets, then recommit with git commit -am "Remove sensitive data".
    Push Again:
        After removing the secrets, try git push origin main again.
    Optional: Unblock the Push (if needed):
        If you need to allow the current commit with secrets (not recommended), follow the provided URLs to unblock the secrets. However, this should only be a temporary measure while you remove the secrets properly.
    Prevent Future Issues:
        Add the secrets to your .gitignore file and use a .gitattributes file with linguist-generated or linguist-vendored to exclude sensitive files from being tracked.

Once you've removed the secrets and amended the commit, the push should succeed. Let me know if you need help with any of these steps!

The code you provided is a PySpark script that streams data from a Kafka topic, processes it, and writes it to an AWS S3 bucket. However, there are a few issues and improvements needed, especially regarding the hardcoded AWS credentials. Here's an analysis and suggestions:
Issues:

    Hardcoded AWS Credentials:
        The AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_KEY are placeholders ("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID" and "AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY") instead of actual values. Hardcoding credentials is a security risk and was likely the cause of the GitHub push block you encountered earlier.
        These should be loaded from environment variables or a secure vault.
    S3 Configuration:
        The S3 bucket name (weatherapi-nivedya) should be verified to ensure it exists and you have the necessary permissions.
    Error Handling:
        The try-except block catches all exceptions but only prints the error. More specific handling could help diagnose issues better.
    Kafka Configuration:
        The KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVER is set to localhost:9092, which assumes Kafka is running locally. This might need adjustment for a production environment.

Suggestions:

    Secure AWS Credentials:
        Use environment variables to load credentials:
        python

    AWS_ACCESS_KEY = os.getenv("AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID")
    AWS_SECRET_KEY = os.getenv("AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY")
    Set these variables in your environment or a configuration file (e.g., .env) outside the codebase, and add the file to .gitignore.

Use IAM Roles (Preferred for AWS):

    If running on an AWS environment (e.g., EC2 or EMR), configure an IAM role with S3 access instead of using access keys. Remove the credential configurations from the Spark session.

Improved Error Handling:

    Add specific exception handling for common issues (e.g., Kafka connection errors, S3 access issues):
    python

    try:
        query.awaitTermination()
    except ValueError as ve:
        print(f"Configuration error: {ve}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An unexpected error occurred: {e}")
    finally:
        spark.stop()

Validate Kafka and S3 Connections:

    Add a check to ensure Kafka and S3 are accessible before starting the stream:
    python

        spark._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set("fs.s3a.access.key", AWS_ACCESS_KEY)
        spark._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set("fs.s3a.secret.key", AWS_SECRET_KEY)
        spark._jsc.hadoopConfiguration().set("fs.s3a.impl", "org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.S3AFileSystem")
        # Test S3 connection (optional)
        spark.read.format("csv").load(f"s3a://{S3_BUCKET}/test").count()
    Optimize S3 Writes:
        The coalesce(1) forces a single partition, which can be slow for large datasets. Consider using repartition with a reasonable number of partitions based on your data size.

The document and link you provided refer to a "Streaming pipeline overview" shared via ChatGPT. However, I don't have direct access to the content of the shared link since it's specific to ChatGPT. Based on the title, it likely contains an overview of a streaming pipeline, possibly similar to the weather-streaming-pipeline project you've been working on.

Since I can't view the specific details, I can offer general guidance. A streaming pipeline overview typically includes:

    Data sources (e.g., Kafka in your case).
    Processing steps (e.g., data transformation with PySpark).
    Storage or output destinations (e.g., S3 in your script).
    Architecture or workflow diagram.

If you'd like me to analyze the specific content, please paste the text or upload the document here. Alternatively, if you have questions about your own streaming pipeline (e.g., the PySpark script you shared earlier), feel free to ask, and I can tailor my response accordingly!

can you please help me to make this type workflow chart making ideas

The image you provided shows a workflow chart for a streaming pipeline with the following components: NewsAPI, Python, Kafka, Spark, AWS, and MongoDB. The arrows indicate the data flow from NewsAPI through Python and Kafka to Spark, then to AWS and MongoDB. To help you create a similar workflow chart, I can guide you through the process conceptually and suggest how to visualize it. Since I can open a canvas panel for charts, I‚Äôll provide a chart configuration that you can use to visualize this workflow.
Steps to Create a Similar Workflow Chart:

    Identify Components:
        List the key elements of your pipeline (e.g., NewsAPI, Python, Kafka, Spark, AWS, MongoDB).
        Determine the data flow between them (e.g., NewsAPI ‚Üí Python ‚Üí Kafka ‚Üí Spark ‚Üí AWS/MongoDB).
    Design the Layout:
        Place each component as a node.
        Use arrows to show the direction of data flow.
        Group related components (e.g., AWS and MongoDB as output destinations).
    Customize Appearance:
        Assign distinct colors or icons to each component for clarity.
        Use a linear or hierarchical layout based on your pipeline structure.
    Use the Canvas Panel:
        I can generate a chart using a code block that you can visualize in the canvas panel. Since your workflow resembles a directed graph, a "scatter" chart type can be adapted to position nodes and connect them with lines.

Suggested Workflow Chart

Based on your image and the weather-streaming-pipeline context, here‚Äôs a chart configuration for a workflow similar to yours. This chart positions the components as nodes and uses lines to represent data flow:
Grok can make mistakes. Always check original sources.
How to Use This:

    Open the canvas panel to visualize this chart.
    The chart places NewsAPI at (0,0), Python at (1,0), Kafka at (2,0), Spark at (3,0), AWS at (4,-1), and MongoDB at (4,1).
    The second dataset with "Connections" draws lines between the nodes to represent data flow.
    Colors are chosen to be distinct and work in both light and dark themes.

Customization Ideas:

    Add More Nodes: Include additional processing steps or data sources (e.g., a weather API instead of NewsAPI).
    Adjust Positions: Modify the x and y coordinates to rearrange the layout (e.g., a vertical flow).
    Label Enhancements: Add more details to the labels (e.g., "Spark Processing" instead of just "Spark").
    Icons: If the canvas supports it, you could replace circles with custom icons (though this chart uses radius r for node size).

If you‚Äôd like to adjust this chart or create a different workflow (e.g., based on your weather-streaming-pipeline), let me know the components and flow, and I can generate a new chart for you!

i want the workflow of this project
README(7).md

Based on the README document you provided for the "Real-Time Weather Data Pipeline" project, the workflow involves fetching weather data from the OpenWeather API, streaming it through Apache Kafka, processing it with Apache Spark Structured Streaming, and storing it in AWS S3 and Snowflake. Below is a conceptual representation of the workflow, which can be visualized as a chart. I‚Äôll provide a chart configuration that you can use in the canvas panel to create a similar workflow diagram to the one you shared earlier.
Workflow Description:

    Data Source: OpenWeather API provides real-time weather data.
    Producer: A Python script (producer.py) fetches data and sends it to Kafka.
    Message Broker: Apache Kafka (topic2) streams the data.
    Processing: Apache Spark Structured Streaming processes the data.
    Storage Destinations:
        AWS S3 stores the processed data as CSV files.
        Snowflake stores the data for analytics.

Chart Configuration

This configuration creates a scatter chart with nodes representing each component and lines showing the data flow, similar to your workflow.png.
Grok can make mistakes. Always check original sources.
How to Use This:

    Open the canvas panel to visualize this chart.
    The chart positions OpenWeather API at (0,0), Python (Producer) at (1,0), Kafka at (2,0), Spark at (3,0), AWS S3 at (4,-1), and Snowflake at (4,1).
    The "Connections" dataset draws lines to represent the data flow from OpenWeather API through Python, Kafka, and Spark to both AWS S3 and Snowflake.
    Colors are assigned to differentiate each component, inspired by your original image.

Customization Ideas:

    Adjust Layout: Change x and y coordinates to create a vertical or circular flow if preferred.
    Add Details: Include additional nodes for optional components like kafka_spark_test.py or weather.py if needed.
    Icons: If supported, replace circles with logos (e.g., OpenWeather, Kafka, Spark icons).
    Annotations: Add text labels or notes on the canvas for extra context (e.g., "Streaming" or "Storage").

This chart reflects the workflow described in your README. If you‚Äôd like to modify it further or integrate additional steps (e.g., from the "Future Improvements" section like Airflow or monitoring), let me know, and I can adjust the configuration accordingly!
7s
Icons: If supported, replace circles with logos (e.g., OpenWeather, Kafka, Spark icons).

neeed this type workflow

Since the canvas panel currently supports a scatter chart with customizable nodes but does not natively support replacing circles with specific logos (e.g., OpenWeather, Kafka, Spark icons) due to limitations in the chart configuration, I‚Äôll enhance the workflow chart by using distinct shapes and colors to represent each component as a proxy for logos. This will give a visual distinction similar to icons while staying within the supported capabilities. I‚Äôll adjust the chart to use different sizes and colors to symbolize the components, and I‚Äôll include labels to clarify their identities.
Updated Workflow Chart

Based on your request and the "Real-Time Weather Data Pipeline" from the README, here‚Äôs an updated chart configuration. I‚Äôll use varying radii (r) and colors to mimic the effect of logos, with arrows to show data flow.
Grok can make mistakes. Always check original sources.
Explanation:

    Node Representation:
        Different radii (r values: 12-16) are used to create visual variety, mimicking the unique shapes of logos.
        Colors are assigned to reflect the branding or typical association (e.g., blue for OpenWeather API, orange for Spark, black for Kafka).
    Data Flow: The "Connections" dataset draws lines from OpenWeather API ‚Üí Python ‚Üí Kafka ‚Üí Spark, splitting to AWS S3 and Snowflake.
    Tooltips: Enabled to show the label of each node when hovered over, enhancing usability.
    Limitations: Since custom logos (e.g., OpenWeather, Kafka, Spark icons) aren‚Äôt supported directly, the varying sizes and colors serve as a substitute.

How to Use:

    Open the canvas panel to visualize this chart.
    The layout positions OpenWeather API at (0,0), Python (Producer) at (1,0), Kafka at (2,0), Spark at (3,0), AWS S3 at (4,-1), and Snowflake at (4,1).
    Hover over nodes to see their labels.

Further Customization:

    Manual Icon Addition: If you have access to an external tool (e.g., Draw.io, Lucidchart), you can export this chart‚Äôs structure and overlay actual logos.
    Additional Nodes: Add nodes for kafka_spark_test.py or weather.py if you want to include them in the workflow.
    Layout Adjustment: Change x and y coordinates for a different arrangement (e.g., vertical or circular).

If you‚Äôd like to refine this further or need help integrating it with another tool for logo support, let me know!

i have drawio

Great! Since you have Draw.io (also known as diagrams.net), you can create a more detailed and visually appealing workflow chart with actual logos or custom icons for your "Real-Time Weather Data Pipeline" project. Draw.io supports importing images, using built-in shapes, and arranging them into a workflow diagram. Below, I‚Äôll guide you through creating a workflow chart similar to the one you shared, incorporating the components from your README (OpenWeather API, Python, Kafka, Spark, AWS S3, Snowflake) with suggestions for adding logos.
Steps to Create the Workflow Chart in Draw.io:

    Open Draw.io:
        Launch Draw.io and start a new blank diagram. You can save it to your local device or a cloud service like Google Drive.
    Set Up the Canvas:
        Go to File > Page Setup to adjust the page size if needed (e.g., A4 or custom dimensions).
        Use the grid (enable via View > Grid) for alignment.
    Add Components as Nodes:
        From the left sidebar, select the "Basic" shape library (or "General" in some versions).
        Drag and drop rectangles or circles to represent each component:
            OpenWeather API
            Python (Producer)
            Kafka
            Spark
            AWS S3
            Snowflake
        Position them in a linear flow: OpenWeather API ‚Üí Python ‚Üí Kafka ‚Üí Spark, with AWS S3 and Snowflake branching out from Spark.
    Add Logos or Icons:
        Import Logos:
            Download logos for OpenWeather API, Kafka, Spark, AWS, and Snowflake from their official websites or free icon resources (ensure proper licensing).
            Go to Arrange > Insert > Image in Draw.io, upload each logo, and resize/position it over the corresponding shape.
        Built-in Icons: If logos aren‚Äôt available, use Draw.io‚Äôs icon library:
            Go to Arrange > Icons and search for relevant symbols (e.g., "cloud" for AWS, "database" for Snowflake, "gear" for Spark).
            Customize colors to match branding (e.g., orange for AWS, black for Kafka).
        Example placement:
            OpenWeather API: Blue cloud or weather icon.
            Python: Yellow snake or code icon.
            Kafka: Black Kafka logo or message icon.
            Spark: Orange spark icon.
            AWS S3: Orange AWS logo or storage icon.
            Snowflake: Sky blue snowflake or database icon.
    Connect the Nodes:
        Use the "Arrow" tool from the toolbar (or Connect in the sidebar) to draw arrows between components:
            OpenWeather API ‚Üí Python
            Python ‚Üí Kafka
            Kafka ‚Üí Spark
            Spark ‚Üí AWS S3 (downward arrow)
            Spark ‚Üí Snowflake (upward arrow)
        Adjust arrow styles (e.g., solid line, curved) via the properties panel.
    Label the Nodes:
        Double-click each shape to add text labels (e.g., "OpenWeather API", "Python (Producer)").
        Use the text tool to add descriptions if needed (e.g., "Fetches weather data" under OpenWeather API).
    Style the Diagram:
        Adjust colors via the "Style" tab (e.g., fill colors to match logos).
        Add a background or title (e.g., "Real-Time Weather Data Pipeline Workflow") using a text box.
        Group related elements (e.g., AWS S3 and Snowflake) with a dashed box if desired.
    Save and Export:
        Save your diagram (File > Save As) in a format like .drawio or export as PNG/JPG (File > Export As > PNG).

Suggested Layout:

    Horizontal Flow: Place components left to right: OpenWeather API (0,0), Python (1,0), Kafka (2,0), Spark (3,0), with AWS S3 (4,-1) and Snowflake (4,1) below and above Spark.
    Icon Sizes: Scale logos to be proportional (e.g., 50x50px or adjust in Draw.io).
    Colors: Use brand colors (e.g., blue for OpenWeather, orange for AWS, sky blue for Snowflake).

Example Workflow Structure:
text
[OpenWeather API] --> [Python (Producer)] --> [Kafka] --> [Spark]
                                               |
                                               --> [AWS S3]
                                               --> [Snowflake]
Tips for Draw.io:

    Layers: Use layers (Arrange > Layers) to organize icons, arrows, and labels separately.
    Templates: Start with a flowchart template (File > New > Flowchart) and customize it.
    Alignment: Use Arrange > Align to keep nodes evenly spaced.

Next Steps:

    If you need specific logo URLs or help finding them, let me know, and I can suggest sources (e.g., official websites or free icon sites like Flaticon).
    Once you‚Äôve created the diagram, you can upload the image here, and I can provide feedback or suggest refinements.
    If you encounter issues in Draw.io, describe them, and I‚Äôll assist!

Go ahead and start designing in Draw.io, and feel free to share your progress or ask for more guidance!

Icons: If supported, replace circles with logos (e.g., OpenWeather, Kafka, Spark icons).

Since you‚Äôve reiterated your request to replace circles with logos (e.g., OpenWeather, Kafka, Spark icons) and mentioned using Draw.io in a previous message, I‚Äôll assume you‚Äôd like further assistance tailored to Draw.io for incorporating logos into your workflow chart for the "Real-Time Weather Data Pipeline." As the canvas panel‚Äôs chart functionality doesn‚Äôt support custom logos directly (limited to shapes and colors), Draw.io is the best tool for this task given your access to it. Below, I‚Äôll provide a detailed guide to create the workflow chart with logos in Draw.io, building on the workflow from your README.
Updated Guide for Draw.io with Logos
1. Open Draw.io and Set Up

    Launch Draw.io and create a new diagram (File > New > Blank Diagram).
    Save it locally or to a cloud service (e.g., Google Drive) as weather_pipeline_workflow.drawio.

2. Add Components with Logos

    Insert Shapes: Use the "Rectangle" or "Ellipse" tool from the left sidebar to create nodes for each component.
    Import Logos:
        Download official logos or icons:
            OpenWeather API: Search for "OpenWeather API logo" (e.g., from their website or a free resource like Flaticon with attribution).
            Python: Use the Python logo (e.g., from python.org).
            Kafka: Apache Kafka logo (e.g., from kafka.apache.org).
            Spark: Apache Spark logo (e.g., from spark.apache.org).
            AWS S3: AWS logo (e.g., from aws.amazon.com).
            Snowflake: Snowflake logo (e.g., from snowflake.com).
        Go to Arrange > Insert > Image, upload each logo file, and resize it to fit within or replace the shape (e.g., 50x50px).
        Alternatively, use Draw.io‚Äôs icon library (Arrange > Icons) and search for terms like "weather," "python," "kafka," "spark," "cloud," or "database" to find similar symbols. Customize colors to match branding.
    Position Nodes:
        Place them in a horizontal flow:
            OpenWeather API at (0, 0)
            Python (Producer) at (200, 0)
            Kafka at (400, 0)
            Spark at (600, 0)
            AWS S3 at (800, -100)
            Snowflake at (800, 100)
        Adjust coordinates via the properties panel for precise alignment.

3. Connect with Arrows

    Select the "Arrow" tool from the toolbar.
    Draw arrows to represent data flow:
        OpenWeather API ‚Üí Python (Producer)
        Python (Producer) ‚Üí Kafka
        Kafka ‚Üí Spark
        Spark ‚Üí AWS S3 (downward)
        Spark ‚Üí Snowflake (upward)
    Customize arrow style (e.g., solid line, thickness) via the properties panel.

4. Label the Nodes

    Double-click each node to add text labels below or beside the logos (e.g., "OpenWeather API", "Python (Producer)").
    Use the text tool to add optional descriptions (e.g., "Fetches weather data" under OpenWeather API).

5. Style the Diagram

    Colors: Match node backgrounds to logo colors (e.g., blue for OpenWeather, orange for AWS) using the "Fill Color" option.
    Title: Add a text box at the top with "Real-Time Weather Data Pipeline Workflow".
    Background: Use a light gray or white background for contrast (Edit > Background Color).
    Alignment: Select all nodes and use Arrange > Align to ensure even spacing.

6. Save and Export

    Save the diagram (File > Save As > weather_pipeline_workflow.drawio).
    Export as PNG or JPG (File > Export As > PNG) to share or include in your README.

Suggested Layout:
text
[OpenWeather API] --> [Python (Producer)] --> [Kafka] --> [Spark]
                                               |
                                               --> [AWS S3]
                                               --> [Snowflake]

    Coordinates: Use approximate x,y values (e.g., (0,0), (200,0), etc.) and adjust in Draw.io.
    Logo Placement: Center each logo within its shape or use it as the shape itself by setting the shape‚Äôs image.

Logo Sources (Suggestions):

    OpenWeather API: Check openweathermap.org for branding guidelines or use a weather icon.
    Python: Download from python.org (yellow snake logo).
    Kafka: kafka.apache.org (black Kafka logo).
    Spark: spark.apache.org (orange spark logo).
    AWS: aws.amazon.com (orange AWS logo).
    Snowflake: snowflake.com (blue snowflake logo).
    Free Alternatives: Flaticon.com or Icons8.com (search for matching icons, ensure proper attribution).

Example in Draw.io:

    Drag a rectangle at (0,0), insert the OpenWeather API logo, label it "OpenWeather API".
    Repeat for Python at (200,0), Kafka at (400,0), Spark at (600,0), AWS S3 at (800,-100), and Snowflake at (800,100).
    Connect with arrows, adjust sizes, and style.

Next Steps:

    Start creating the diagram in Draw.io following these steps.
    If you need help finding specific logos or encounter issues (e.g., alignment, image import), let me know, and I can provide more detailed assistance.
    Once completed, you can upload the exported image here, and I can review it or suggest refinements.

Let me know how it goes or if you need a step-by-step walkthrough for a specific part!

just need a updation in readme file that is mentioning the workflow correctly

Based on the workflow described in your README file and the discussions about the "Real-Time Weather Data Pipeline," I'll update the README to include a correct and detailed description of the workflow. The workflow involves fetching weather data from the OpenWeather API, processing it through Python, streaming it via Kafka, processing with Spark, and storing it in AWS S3 and Snowflake. I'll add a new section or update the existing content to reflect this accurately.

Here‚Äôs the updated portion of your README file with the workflow section added or modified. I‚Äôll integrate it into the existing structure while keeping the formatting consistent.

# üå¶Ô∏è Real-Time Weather Data Pipeline

This project is an **end-to-end streaming pipeline** that fetches weather forecast data from the **OpenWeather API**, streams it through **Apache Kafka**, processes it with **Apache Spark Structured Streaming**, and stores it into **AWS S3** and **Snowflake** for analytics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üìÇ Project Structure

-   **producer.py** ‚Üí Fetches weather data from OpenWeather API and pushes it into Kafka (`topic2`).
-   **kafka_spark_test.py** ‚Üí Spark consumer to test and validate incoming Kafka messages.
-   **weather.py** ‚Üí Standalone script to fetch and display weather forecast (without Kafka).
-   **aws_s3.py** ‚Üí Spark streaming consumer that writes weather data into **AWS S3 (CSV format)**.
-   **snowflake.py** ‚Üí Spark streaming consumer that writes weather data into **Snowflake tables**.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used

-   **Apache Kafka** ‚Üí Message broker for streaming weather data.
-   **Apache Spark (Structured Streaming)** ‚Üí Stream processing engine.
-   **AWS S3** ‚Üí Data lake storage (CSV).
-   **Snowflake** ‚Üí Cloud data warehouse for analytics.
-   **OpenWeather API** ‚Üí Weather forecast provider.
-   **Python (3.8+)** ‚Üí Programming language for producer and consumers.
-   **python-dotenv** ‚Üí For managing credentials securely.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Pipeline
Step 1: Start Kafka & Zookeeper
bash
zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

Create the topic:
bash
kafka-topics.sh --create --topic topic2 --bootstrap-server localhost:9092
Step 2: Run the Producer
bash
python producer.py

This fetches weather data for Kochi, Bangalore, and Mumbai and publishes to Kafka.
Step 3: Test Consumer (Optional)
bash
python kafka_spark_test.py

This verifies data ingestion and schema parsing.
Step 4: Stream to AWS S3
bash
python aws_s3.py

Stores Kafka data batches as CSV in your S3 bucket.
Step 5: Stream to Snowflake
bash
python snowflake.py

Writes Kafka data into Snowflake tables.
üìä Workflow

The pipeline follows this workflow:

    Data Ingestion: The OpenWeather API provides real-time weather forecast data.
    Data Production: The producer.py script, written in Python, fetches data for cities (e.g., Kochi, Bangalore, Mumbai) and publishes it to the Kafka topic (topic2).
    Data Streaming: Apache Kafka acts as the message broker, streaming the weather data to downstream consumers.
    Data Processing: Apache Spark Structured Streaming (via aws_s3.py and snowflake.py) processes the streamed data, transforming it into a structured format.
    Data Storage:
        Processed data is written to AWS S3 as CSV files by aws_s3.py.
        Processed data is also loaded into Snowflake tables by snowflake.py for analytics.

This workflow ensures continuous data flow from ingestion to storage, enabling real-time analytics and storage.

## üìä Example Output

### Producer JSON Message

``` json
{
  "City": "Kochi",
  "Date": "2025-08-22 12:00:00",
  "Temperature (Celsius)": 28.34,
  "Weather": "Cloudy",
  "Humidity (%)": 84,
  "Wind Speed (m/s)": 4.6
}
```

### AWS S3 CSV Output

    city,date,temperature,weather,humidity,windspeed
    Kochi,2025-08-22 12:00:00,28.34,Cloudy,84,4.6

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## üöÄ Future Improvements

-   Dockerize the pipeline (Kafka + Spark + S3 + Snowflake)
-   Add monitoring & logging
-   Use Airflow for orchestration
-   Integrate dashboards (Power BI / Tableau / Superset)
